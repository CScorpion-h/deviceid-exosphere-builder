# DeviceID Exosphere Builder

Dockerized tool to build a custom Exosphere binary that spoofs the DeviceID. This can be used to boot Horizon with Atmosphere in a Nintendo Switch with  transplanted `PRODINFO`/`PRODINFOF` partitions

## How to transplant PRODINFO/PRODINFOF and recreate the other EMMC partitions from scratch

### WARNING
**This procedure is only meant to be able to boot the console back into Horizon, after losing the contents of `PRODINFO`/`PRODINFOF` partitions. THIS IS NOT MEANT TO UNBAN YOUR CONSOLE. If you try doing that, the most likely outcome is that you will end up with another banned console. Avoid any kind of piracy from now on and DON'T USE the transplanted console online**

### Requirements:
- Windows
- A working console full EMMC backup (*Console A*), or that console running latest Hekate, connected to the PC
- A console with working hardware, but without a working EMMC backup (*Console B*)
- [NxNandManager](https://github.com/eliboa/NxNandManager)
- [HackDiskMount](https://files.sshnuke.net/HacDiskMount1055.zip)
- BIS keys for Console A and B
- Docker
- Latest [Hekate](https://github.com/CTCaer/hekate/releases)
- Latest [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases/)

### Steps
1. Open the EMMC from *Console A* or its backup with NxNandManager, using *Console A* BIS keys
1. Write down the *DeviceID*, without the initial `NX` and the `-0` (or whatever there is) at the end. For instance, if it says: `NX1122334455667788-0`, your device would be: `1122334455667788`
1. Dump and decrypt `PRODINFO` and `PRODINFOF` partitions from *Console A*
1. Close NxNandManager
1. Open the EMMC from *Console B* with NxNandManager, using *Console B* BIS keys. It may say that it has *BAD CRYPTO*. This is expected on a nuked EMMC.
1. Restore the decrypted `PRODINFO` and `PRODINFO` partitions from Console A into Console B
1. Close NxNandManager
1. Follow [this guide](https://switch.homebrew.guide/usingcfw/manualchoiupgrade.html) to recreate the rest of the EMMC partitions, `BOOT0` and `BOOT1` on *Console B* using *Console B* BIS keys, **UP TO AND INCLUDING, STEP 12. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO BOOT THE CONSOLE YET**.
1. On the `SYSTEM` partition, delete all the files/folders of the `save` folder **except the one ending in `120`**. Not doing this may end up in the console freezing during boot or Atmosphere showing an error while booting.
1. Put the latest version of Hekate and Atmosphere on your SD card.
1. Create the custom Exosphere binary to spoof the DeviceID.
1. Boot the console using `fusee-primary.bin` or chainload it from Hekate

## How to create the custom Exosphere binary 

This tool requires a volume mounted to the `/output` directory of the container, and the `DEVICEID` environment variable, with the DeviceID to spoof.

Either build the docker image locally or use the prebuilt image from Dockerhub, replacing the `DEVICEID` value with your DeviceID:

```bash
mkdir -p ./output
docker run -ti --rm -e DEVICEID=0x1122334455667788 -v "$PWD"/output:/output pablozaiden/deviceid-exosphere-builder:latest
```

After it finishes building, copy the `output/deviceid_exosphere.bin` file to the `Atmosphere` directory of your SD card, and add the following entries to `BCT.ini`:

```ini
[stage2]
exosphere = atmosphere/deviceid_exosphere.bin
```

## Important. Do not share your dumps and personalized builds.
The `deviceid_exosphere.bin` is tied to a specific DeviceID and *must not be shared*. The same applies for the `PRODINFO`/`PRODINFOF` dumps. You may end up with a banned console.
